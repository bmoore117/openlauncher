To disable safe mode completely, you must set the app as device owner.
This can be done through ADB, as long as there are no other accounts on the device, e.g. the app
is the first account.

To delete all accounts, go into settings and delete everything present, then use the following
command to find the remaining apps with accounts, and uninstall each:
    .\adb.exe shell dumpsys account

As a note, you may have to disable some built-in apps, such as gmail and google play services, to
get those accounts to disappear. Make sure to re-enable them afterwards

Then do:
    .\adb.exe shell dpm set-device-owner com.benny.openlauncher/com.benny.openlauncher.receivers.DeviceAdminReceiver
